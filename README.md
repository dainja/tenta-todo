# tenta-todo

created local api using json-server

won't work without it.


# usage
clone git
npm install
(installs json-server)

npm start
(starts local server at default port:3000 , watching the local db.json)

You can now use the todo app, it starts with fetch GET, it will GET all the todos in "storage" (db.json) and print it to DOM.

add task = post

delete task = delete
